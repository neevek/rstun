rstun
=====

A TCP/UDP tunnel over QUIC written in Rust.

rstun is a high-performance TCP/UDP tunneling solution. It leverages the [Quinn](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn) library for [QUIC](https://quicwg.org/) transport, ensuring efficient, low-latency bidirectional communication, secured by QUIC’s integrated TLS layer.

Key Features
------------

* TCP and UDP tunneling over a single QUIC tunnel.
* Encryption provided by QUIC’s inherent TLS layer.
* Bidirectional communication support over a single QUIC tunnel

Operating Modes
-----

* Inbound Tunneling (IN Mode)

  In `IN` mode, rstunc allows you to expose a local service (e.g., a web server or application) to the public internet securely through the QUIC tunnel. This mode is useful for scenarios where a service is running locally behind a NAT or firewall but needs to be accessible from outside.

* Outbound Tunneling (OUT Mode)

  In `OUT` mode, rstunc securely tunnels local outbound traffic through rstund, which then forwards it to the specified destination. This mode is commonly used to encrypt and route traffic from a local network to external servers, leveraging QUIC for enhanced performance and security.


Components
----------

rstun consists of two binaries:

* rstunc (client): Establishes and manages tunnels to the server.
* rstund (server): Accepts incoming connections and forwards TCP and UDP traffic according to the configured routing rules.

Example
=======

* Start the server

```
rstund \
  --addr 0.0.0.0:6060 \
  --tcp-upstream 8800 \
  --udp-upstream 8.8.8.8:53 \
  --password 123456 \
  --cert path/to/cert.der \
  --key path/to/key.der
```
  - `--addr` specifies the ip:port that the server is listening on.
  - `--tcp-upstream` is the default TCP upstream for `OUT` mode tunneling if the client doesn't specify one. Traffic from the client through the tunnel will be forwarded to this upstream.
  - `--udp-upstream` is the default UDP upstream for `OUT` mode tunneling if the client doesn't specify one. Traffic from the client through the tunnel will be forwarded to this upstream.
  - `--password`, password of the server, the client `rstunc` is required to send this password to successfully build a tunnel with the server.
  - `cert` and `key` are certificate and private key for the domain of the server, self-signed certificate is allowed, but you will have to connect to the server using IP address and the certificate will also be required by `rstunc` for verification in this case (see below). Anyway, getting a certificate for your domain from a trusted CA and connecting to the server using domain name is always recommended. Note `cert` and `key` are optional, if they are not specified, the domain `localhost` is assumed and a self-signed certificate is generated on the fly, but this is for TEST only, Man-In-The-Middle attack can occur with such setting, so make sure **it is only used for TEST**!

* Start the client

```
rstunc
  --mode OUT \
  --server-addr 1.2.3.4:6060 \
  --password 123456 \
  --cert path/to/cert.der \
  --tcp-mapping 0.0.0.0:9900^8800 \
  --loglevel D
```
  - `--mode`, `OUT` for securing data from local to the server through the tunnel.
  - `--server-addr`, domain name or IP address of the server.
  - `--password`, same as that for the server.
  - `--cert`, see explanation above for `rstund`. Note this is also optional if connecting to the server with a domain name, or the server `rstund` runs with an auto-generated self-signed certificate (see the TEST example below).
  - `--addr-mapping` is an address mapping between two `ip:port` pairs separated by the `^` character, the format is `[ip:]port^[ip:]port`, in the example above, a local port `9900` is mapped to the remote port `8800` of the `1.2.3.4` server that runs `rstund`. i.e. all traffic from the local port `9900` will be forwarded to the remote port `8800` through the tunnel. `--addr-mapping` also supports using `ANY` as the second part of the mapping for `OUT` mode tunneling, in which case, the server default will be used. For example `9900^ANY`.

* Simple TEST example

The following commands run a server, then a client that connects to the server in their simplest ways:


```
# Remote: run the server with auto-generated self-signed certificate
rstund -a 9000 -p 1234

# Local: connect to the server (127.0.0.1:9000) and bind both the TCP and UDP port 9900 to remote TCP and UDP port 8800
rstunc -m OUT -a 127.0.0.1:9000 -p 1234 -t 0.0.0.0:9900^8800 -u 0.0.0.0:9900^8800
```
